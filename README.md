# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is undoubtedly one of the most important problems in the field of driverless cars and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). TSR enables the front-facing smart cameras mounted on the car to recognize the signboards so that the car can act accordingly. Some examples include recognizing stop signs, speed limit, turn signs etc.
