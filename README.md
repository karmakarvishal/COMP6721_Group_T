# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is undoubtedly one of the most important problems in the field of driverless cars and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). TSR enables the front-facing smart cameras mounted on the car to recognize the signboards so that the car can act accordingly. Some examples include recognizing stop signs, speed limit, turn signs etc.

In order to run the resnet trainings, you need to run the jupyter notebook of the training you want. Each file is named with the architecture and data set it is trained on. Example:(resnet18_BTSD.ipynb for the training of resnet18 on the data set BTSD.)

In order to run the alexnet trainings, you need to run the jupyter notebook of the training you want. Each file is named with the architecture and data set it is trained on. Example:(Alexnet_BTSD.ipynb for the training of AlexNet on the data set BTSD.)

In order to run the GoogLeNet trainings, you need to run the jupyter notebook of the training you want. Each file is named with the architecture and data set it is trained on. Example:(GoogleNet_BTSD.ipynb for the training of GoogLeNet on the data set BTSD.)

In order to run the VGG-16 trainings, you need to run the jupyter notebook of the training you want. Each file is named with the architecture and data set it is trained on. Example:(vgg16_BTSD.ipynb for the training of VGG-16 on the data set BTSD.)
